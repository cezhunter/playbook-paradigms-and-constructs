# Naming

As far as naming conventions are concerned, I have two pieces of advice:

1. Be consistent. No matter what you decide to do, stick with it.
2. If you do change the name of an app, don't make it too specific. If you make it to specific if (read when) you have to change the playbook itself, you will have to also change the title (or more likely you will forget to change the title and the title will not describe what the app actually does). For example, if you have a timer trigger that runs every Monday, don't name it "Run every monday", but instead name it something like "Run weekly". This way, if you change the day on which the app runs, you don't have to change the title of the app as well.
